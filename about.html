              <h2>Hello!</h2>
              <p>My name is Raquel Román-Rodriguez <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Spanish" title="Help:IPA/Spanish">[raˈkɛl roˈmãn roðɾiˈɣes]</a>, 
              and I am studying to become a software engineer.</p>
              <p>I am using this page to explore and document my journey as I learn to code.</p>
              <p>In 2018, I completed a Master of Music degree in Vocal Performance at the Cleveland Institute of Music. I have been singing professionally, teaching voice, and conducting 
                choral ensembles at the collegiate level ever since. However, in the wake of the Coronavirus pandemic, I have begun to rethink my career path.</p>
              <p>My dad and my husband are both programmers, and I have always found code facinating, so here I am!</p>

              under the covers, being picked up, and bananas. She hates the wind and the fact that other dogs would dare exist.

              She is missing her right-lower canine tooth, so her tongue hangs out all the time. She hates that it isn't time for dinner yet.

            <h5 id="song-titles"><em>Te Quiero, Dijiste (Muñequita Linda)</em> & <em>Júrame</em> by María Grever</h5>
            <p id="about-songs">This performance is from my Master's recital in 2018. My friend and collaborator, Maria Parrini, is the pianist.<br><br>
              As a singer, I have a particular interest in Latin American Art Song. In the Western Classical world, Latin American music has historically
              been excluded and overlooked, despite its artistic merits. I plan to continue my work in performing, researching, and uplifting this incredible
              music throughout my life.
              <br><br>
              These two pieces are both written by María Grever, a Mexican composer. Many of Grever's works were featured in films during
              the Golden Age of Film in Mexico in the 1930s. She wrote over 1000 works of song and her works reached international acclaim during her life,.
              <br><br>
              The first piece, <em>Te Quiero, Dijiste (Muñequita Linda)</em>, is a famous example 
              of a <em>bolero</em>, a type of Latin American romantic song that originated from the <em>trova</em> style in Cuba in the late 19th-century.
              It is also my abuelo's favorite song of all time and performing it was a special experience for me.
              <br><br>
              The second piece, <em>Júrame</em>, is one of Grever's most celebrated works of all time. The singer is passionately pleading with their lover 
              to <em>swear to them</em> that their love is true.
